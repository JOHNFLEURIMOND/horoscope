![2018 To Do List!](horoscope/horoscope.png)

# My Awesome Project
This is an simple to-do Horoscope application that allows the user to enter in two different inputs and returning their reading for the day. One being for the month they were born and the other for the day on a click of a button!

## How It's Made:
HTML, CSS, Javascript Framework of choice Under the Hood:First starting off with the HTML, I created two inputs for the user to populate with their date of birth; as well a button to return the result! I used JavaScript to implement a function for the button with an if or else statement depending on what the user submitted!

## Optimizations
After now looking at it, I would have like to fix the placement from everything and stop it from moving when the resulted are show.

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what my experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time I build something I always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *ahh ha moment* . During this project I learned that the JavaScript language can do a ton for work with the if or else statement.
